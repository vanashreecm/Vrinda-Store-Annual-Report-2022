📦 Sales Performance Dashboard – Apparel Retail

📌Business Problem  
Retail businesses, particularly in the apparel sector, frequently encounter challenges in understanding sales behaviour across diverse customer segments, channels, and regions. Without clear visibility into order patterns, demographics, and fulfilment status, it's hard to identify what's working and what’s holding growth back. This dashboard addresses the need for holistic data analysis to enhance customer satisfaction and streamline operations.

Dashboard Goal  
The objective of this dashboard is to:
- Present a unified view of sales performance segmented by time, geography, channel, gender, age group, and order status  
- Uncover actionable insights that support strategic decisions in inventory planning, marketing, and customer engagement  
- Highlight operational efficiency through delivery metrics and payment trends  

📊 Charts and Visuals Explained  

- Orders vs Sales (Combo Chart): A blend of bar and line visuals showcasing monthly sales volume (₹40M to ₹100M range)          alongside the number of orders (up to 3,000). This helps track seasonal trends and understand how order count and revenue     correlate.

- Order Status Overview: Bar chart visualising delivery outcomes—delivered, cancelled, refunded, and returned. With over        28,000 successful deliveries and minimal returns/refunds, it reflects a strong fulfilment pipeline.

- Sales by Gender (Pie Chart): Reveals that women contribute to 64% of total sales, while men account for 36%. This indicates   which demographic drives the business and informs targeted campaigns.

- Sales Across Top 5 States (Bar Chart): Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu lead in total         sales, ranging from ₹1.6M to nearly ₹ 3 M. Helps prioritise geographical expansion or promotional efforts.

- Order Channels (Pie Chart): Ajio tops with 35.5% share, followed by Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Meesho, and niche players       like Nalli. This distribution guides channel-specific planning and resource allocation.

- Sales by Age Group and Gender (Bar Chart): Adult customers dominate in spending, followed by teenagers and seniors. A         gender breakdown within each age group provides granular insights for audience-specific marketing.
